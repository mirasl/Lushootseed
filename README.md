# Seattle Lushootseed

Seattle Lushootseed is an application for Android designed to provide an accessible entry into Lushootseed and its history in the Seattle area.
Throughout the past few decades, many people have spent a large amount of time and effort in preserving the Lushootseed language, but much of this
work is buried deeply in the internet, and most of it is largely unaccessible unless one is willing to dive deep into the language on their own.

Features:
- An explanation of the Lushootseed alphabet and its various sounds
- A list of vocabulary words that is not hardcoded and flexible to updates (see CONTRIBUTE file)
- A simple flashcard feature to practice the vocabulary terms
- An interactive map of the Seattle area displaying various Lushootseed place names
- Information about the history of the Lushootseed language


FAQ:

Q: "How can I contribute to the vocabulary words?"
A: All you need to do is edit the vocab.json file - see CONTRIBUTE file for details!

Q: "Why is this being made in a physics/game engine?"
A: Because Godot's UI program works well, but really because I was on a strict schedule and didn't have any time to learn an alternative.
