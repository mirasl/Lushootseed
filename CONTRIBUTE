How to contribute vocabulary (it is very simple, no coding needed!):

(intro)
This application was purposefully designed around the idea of constantly being able to update vocabulary terms.
Lushootseed is not an incredibly widespread language, and thus a lot of vocabulary is lacking - many words are likely already
lost forever. Because of the language's smaller scale, it is not widely available across the internet or other immiediate sources outside
of the Lushootseed Dictionary. It is entirely possible (and likely) that speakers of Lushootseed are aware of many nuances
and even possibly extra words which have never been documented. As language preservation hopefully continues, this app can be
updated to reflect advances.

HOW TO CONTRIBUTE:
All the vocabulary used in the app is stored in the vocab.json file. The vocabulary is stored in the following format:

{"Term":"<LUSHOOTSEED WORD HERE>", "Definition":"<ENGLISH WORD HERE>", "Category":"<CATEGORY HERE>"},

(Note that the last line will not have a comma, and the entire document is enclosed in [] brackets as a dictionary.
With the example above: everything within <>, including the <> symbols, should be replaced with the intended term.)

In order to change vocabulary, all you have to do is add or edit a line following the above format and the rest of the
app should respond accordingly. The vocabulary terms will be added to the vocabulary list in the app as well as the
flashcards, and will be sorted by category. Feel free to create your own new categories, the app will automatically create 
more category filters/flashcard decks as needed.

Thank you!
